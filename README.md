# Legal-RAG-System
# ⚖️ Legal Document Q&A using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to efficiently extract and answer queries from large-scale legal documents. The system combines document retrieval with language generation to provide accurate, context-aware responses.

It is designed to assist legal professionals in quickly finding relevant clauses and insights from complex legal texts.

## 🎯 Business Objective
Legal teams often deal with large volumes of contracts and policies, making manual search time-consuming and inefficient.

The objective of this project is to:
- Retrieve relevant legal information efficiently
- Provide accurate answers to legal queries
- Reduce time spent on document review
- Improve decision-making using data-driven insights

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of legal documents stored as text files across multiple categories:

- **contractnli** → Confidentiality & NDA agreements  
- **cuad** → Contracts with annotated clauses  
- **maud** → Merger & acquisition agreements  
- **privacy_qa** → Privacy policies with Q&A format  

Additionally, benchmark datasets (JSON format) contain:
- Questions  
- Ground truth answers  
- Source references

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 🔹 1. Document Loading
- Loaded text documents from multiple folders
- Structured data for processing

### 🔹 2. Text Chunking
- Split documents into smaller chunks for better retrieval

### 🔹 3. Embedding Generation
- Converted text into vector embeddings using LLM-based models

### 🔹 4. Vector Database
- Stored embeddings using FAISS for fast similarity search

### 🔹 5. Retrieval System
- Retrieved relevant document chunks based on query

### 🔹 6. Response Generation
- Used LLM (via LangChain / LlamaIndex) to generate contextual answers
